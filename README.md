# google-power-search
A power tool for power users of Google. This tool helps you more relevant, personalized, and useful results from your Google searches, all using Google search's built-in operators.

# 30 second pitch
Finding the correct Google query string is an art in and of itself. We made this productivity tool for those times when you're looking for something specific, but other results keep drowning out what you're looking for. The tool works by using the advanced search operators already built in to Google search. However, for the casual user memorizing these operators can be difficult, so we decided to spend a weekend building this tool! Oh wait... Anyway, if your topic takes on multiple settings, or you're looking for a particular filetype, phrase, or word, this is the tool that is one click away--and it will be there to save the day. Superman's got nothin' on *\~Advanced Google Search\~*!

# The dev stack
Coming off of a tough semester with lots of new languages, algorithms, and frameworks, we decided to stick with good ol' vanilla html, css, and javascript for this project.

# Why we built this
We built this for the 2020 Hack the Northeast (HTNE) -- a virtual hackathon.

## Backstory
Back in 2014, one of our team members was sitting bored in his Human Geography class when he noticed a poster on the wall. It touted the use of "Advanced Google Search Operators" for more effective Googling. He stayed after class to study the poster, picking up a few basic operators for his daily use. These operators have helped him to this day, and now, 6 years later, he's back with a team.

It has been said that "Life is like Google: You need to know what you're searching for." Offering customized ways to search the internet, we are set on making this simple tool to make it easier for anyone to do exactly that.

tl;dr: Public school inspired us to make an achievable, yet impactful, project for this hackathon.

# Ideation
Nearly everyone uses Google to search the web, but there are, in fact, advanced operators that can be used to augment the regular searches. For example, here is an (almost complete) list of operators.

# Inspiration 
In addition to the search modification functionality, we also wanted to generate the "Search String" as the user started to list requirements. Because the user can see the Search String being built, it gives them control over their inputs. And, in each text field's default state, inputs are prefilled with suggestions which prompts the user to type inputs in the correct format.

Additionally, placing each module in close proximity with each other appeals to Fitt's Law by reducing the amount of time a user needs to navigate between the different options.

# Implementation
### Our first prototype (complete with the ideas and requirements)

### Second prototype (this time with some *~\Google\~* colors)

### Third prototype (search bar and module locations moved + dark background)
![prototype #3](/DocumentationImages/prototype-3.png)

### Fourth prototype (adding headers with "How to Use" and "Fun examples" button + social media icons)
![prototype #4](/DocumentationImages/prototype-4.png)

### Fifth prototype (making the website responsive)

### Overview of iterations
In the interest of time, we used rapid prototyping--we're not kidding...
